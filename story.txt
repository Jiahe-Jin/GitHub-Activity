The Rabbit and the turtle

One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. 
Much to the rabbitâ€™s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke
and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the judger of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced 
way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought. (Written by Jiahe)         

After few miles away, the rabbit felt a little tired and wanted to have a rest under a tree. Although the 
rabit concerned that the turtle may chased up when he was sleeping, he still slept under the tree to have a rest.
Even though the turtle was pretty slow, the turtle finally chased up the rabit and continued to move to the end. --- written by Liangqi Cai

When the turtle almost got to the end point, the rabbit got up and found that he was about to lose. He thought it was too late, but he started to sprint again to catch him up.
Soon, the rabbit could chased up the turtule. Although, the turtle tried his best, he could not beat the rabbit's gifted talent. ---Written by Seungjun Chong (Jayden)
